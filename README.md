## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Working on this challenge help me to work with more semanctic HTML5 elements which actually helped me to also understand and make sure that what I'm using is already accessible.

The use of Javascript was just to keep consistency to add some "aria" attributes and find a small workaround to toggle the icons to each summary. I realized that I can change the markers using CSS but the results were not as expected so I went for another different approach.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue improving my coding skills by recreating this challenge using a library or framework. But for the moment, I think I'm cool with this.


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) - MDN is always a good resource to follow and look for accesibility compliance. This specific page helped me to know how the `details` element works.
