## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Working on this challenge help me to work with more semanctic HTML5 elements which actually helped me to also understand and make sure that what I'm using is already accessible.

The use of Javascript was just to keep consistency to add some "aria" attributes and find a small workaround to toggle the icons to each summary. I realized that I can change the markers using CSS but the results were not as expected so I went for another different approach.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue improving my coding skills by recreating this challenge using a library or framework. But for the moment, I think I'm cool with this.


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) - MDN is always a good resource to follow and look for accesibility compliance. This specific page helped me to know how the `details` element works.
